#### Self-Hosting

# Building and Running Formbricks from Source

This approach provides the flexibility to configure every aspect of your Formbricks instance, including environment variables that need to be set at build time. While we don't recommend changing the source code of Formbricks, this method allows you to set your own configuration that might be necessary for specific deployment needs. Keep in mind that this method requires a more in-depth understanding of Docker and the build process. However, the trade-off is the additional control and flexibility you gain, making it worth considering if you're a more advanced user or have very specific configuration needs.

### Requirements

Ensure `docker` & `docker compose` are installed on your server/system. Both are typically included with Docker utilities, like Docker Desktop and Rancher Desktop.

<Note>
  `docker compose` without the hyphen is now the primary method of using docker-compose, according to the
  Docker documentation.
</Note>

1.  **Clone the repository**:

   <CodeGroup title="Clone and cd into the Formbricks directory">

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks.git && cd formbricks
    ```

   </CodeGroup>

2.  **Modify the `.env.docker` file as required by your setup.** <br/> This file comes with a basic setup and Formbricks works without making any changes to the file. To enable email sending functionality you need to configure the SMTP settings. If you configured your email credentials, you can also comment the following lines to enable email verification (`# NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_DISABLED=1`) and password reset (`# NEXT_PUBLIC_PASSWORD_RESET_DISABLED=1`)

        <Note>
           ## Editing a NEXT_PUBLIC_* variable?
          Note: All environment variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are used at build time. When you change
          environment variables later, you need to rebuild the image with `docker compose build` for the changes
          to take effect.
        </Note>

3.  **Start the docker compose process.** <br/> Finally start the docker compose process to build and spin up the Formbricks container as well as the PostgreSQL database. <br/> _Use docker-compose if you are on an older docker version_

   <CodeGroup title="Launch docker instances">

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    You can now access the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You will be automatically redirected to the login. To use your local installation of Formbricks, create a new account.

### Important Run-time Variables

These variables must also be provided at runtime.

Please refer to the [Formbricks Instructions](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks) for more details on generating these variables.

## Debugging

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs of the container with:

<CodeGroup title="Docker container logs">

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

</CodeGroup>

You can close the logs again with `CTRL + C`.
